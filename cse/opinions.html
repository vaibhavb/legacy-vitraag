    <h2>28th Feb 2001: "Riots, India, Trains and We"</h2>
 
    <p>The "Familiar Train Incident" immmediately puts me in to a reflective
 mood. I feel a strange fear in me to be an Indian and what it will be like
 when i go back home! Heres what turned out from some mails and  conversations. 
    </p>
    <pre>hey,<br><br>Here is what CNN feels:<br>"In India 400 ppl die as Hindu fundamentalists run a mockery of <br>the system as an aftermath of Moslems burning a train which carried <br>activists going to build a temple at site where a moslem mosque was <br>devastated earlier."<br><br>And Here's what i feel:<br>The western media is not very good with India and the general public here <br>thinks that India is a place of elephants and poor; recently of Yoga and <br>Music.<br><br>We are a democratic nation. I always feel strong abt all this so lemme <br>unleash.People say "thats the biggest flaw....we shudnt have ever been <br>free..." i don't at all agree with all that, the firangis are and will <br>remain a bunch of chameleoned leechers. I felt surely "wish we were not <br>free" but that was my childish anger of current system. You see its we <br>who can make a difference, not a third person.  <br><br>"What the hell how can anyone be so mercilessly burn the train". Thats <br>true, but its just a part of the picture not the whole thing. You see, no <br>country in the world will ever edure such a thing done with the majority <br>population. So we should not but the catch is how do we react? All the <br>firangis, press and high profile are sold out to the physicality, hopeless <br>ppl!!<br><br>Can't we do anything? I think ppl shud go out and catch<br>catch each sole and ask him wether he is an Indian, not Hindu or Muslim. <br>If he says yes ask him to join save the country. People say "Gandhi did <br>the biggest blunder in his life"? No way! My mom used to tell me he was a <br>great man n i used to fight with her abt that<br>but u see he had something else in mind he was too naive. Each moslem shud <br>be asked to pledge solidarity with the country. if not leave it. Ppl say <br>"all moslems should be thrown out of India". No way, i know moslems who r <br>Indains. I have had close friends that are as much indian as n e of us. <br>Ppl say "ya but a majority of them are not like us its bcoz of them we r <br>suffering". Thats the clitch, majority - get to them<br>but don't let the mionority go they will form the nation. For that matter <br>many hindus in india shud be outcasted.<br><br>I have come to one conclusion and there are reasons for that the <br>importance of gov should be reduced to zero. That will be possible only if <br>consumerism n capitalism comes in. Everything goes for money n <br>consumption. i HATE that, but u see that lesser evil,<br>eyerything sums up to the same thing. And i'm happy that its catching up <br>like n e thing in India, soo nuthing to regret things have to change its <br>high time.<br><br>Lets see whether we can make a difference or not. We always talk abt kool <br>things and our society kinda hates<br>political talk they think its dirty its just remanant of slavery i suppose <br>and partly becoz its really dirty.<br><br>Thats all for now!!!<br><br>I guess it was rather a huge mail. But u see am i frank as ever!!!<br><br></pre>
