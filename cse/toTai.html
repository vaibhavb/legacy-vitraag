i wanna to try n answer few questions

Bete ke future plans kya hai

Beta Wapiis ayega ke nahi

A big question right

hey but u cant say it at this stage

what does he feel abt it

it has been a long time he has been away from home

so how does home kno whats up

hmmmm aare all these questions are diff to ans 

dont u feel??

yep!!

who else will feel that

thy pain u all the time

hmm

doosara hai

beta wahi shaadi tu nahi kar lega

shaadi ko phir bhi time hai lekin valid question

aare tere parnts bhi like my parents

worried all the time

hahaah

yep! 

ur parents might be more worried

esp now!!

aare the thing is they want me to get settled and stuff

u know wat i mean by that

but then they never force me into anything

oic life mein settle

agar shadi nahi karni to nahi sahi abhi

hona mangta hai

hee

how worried r thy abt ur bro

yeah they are

i think n times more right

hmmm

aare but c

he is doin phd rite now

hmm

how can he be settled now at this point

hmm

soo more time to him 

lease exended right

soo another question is does beta have n e one in mind at this time....

u see all these are premature q's

but they are valid

does beta care for arranged marriage 

he does isnt it??

given my community

hmm...do i

that will be a big answer to me

hey tel me do u have neone in mind

thats really strange

i dunno

i thnk it will require some time to figure out

and u kno its a NP-complete problem

isnt it 

ohh maybe

whoz she

tell me that atleast

i'll let u kno as soon as i kno

agee dont try to get answer from a question

u confusing me now

nopes the answer is simple

its premature

and i dunno much abt myself



beta strange hai

y doesn't he do simple things and earn money which he can

what are his soo called dreams or conditions

why doesn't he think like everyone does

it depends frm individul to individual

hmmm see didnt i say u r diff

y does he want to care for things he may/may not help better

y does it has to be hard way

will he give away or stick

all questions are highly unanswerable

hmmmm i m thinking frm u r point of view too

first fact is do i kno what i want to do 

c u r capable...

u can get anything...and everything

can i

u can

beleive me

one sec brb soo soo 

soo but whats the thing which has to be done

i know all the questions in front of u r not answerable rite now

something which makes a difference where its most needed

hmm..but kno an attempt can be made

attempt as in wat?

soo that ur near n dear ones kno wht u r upto

ya exactly

u kno what is my fear in life

u need to ans them sumthing

nope

yep

say 

suppose due to my stupid view

i'm not able to succeed (as in make suff money) in life

and give a good life to my parents

ummm that wud ever happen ...take it frm me...

dont think in a negative way dear

wont that be a greatest blunder

its not -ve but ready for the worst

soo what i thnk is if my dear ones kno

that i made a sincere attempt

they will alwaz support u 

no matter wat

i wont be that bad

it

wht do u think

c they will be besides u in u r good and bad times..

u kno thats all said

no matter wat

but the basic needs of life make all fundas

baseless

no doubt thy will but??

life is not easy at all...

esp if u r a professional person..

ppl expecta lottttt frm u isnt it

hmm yep!!

i always feel that if i cant make a difference then no pt

hummm 

but u kno one has to have a solid base ...to speak all this stuff

y so??

life is kinda of a balance

becoz of basic human needs

and expectations

hey needs kyu hai itne

y do we expect so much

thats what depends on person

finally is sab ka end kya hai

marna hi to hai sabko

thats way too far fetched 

god knows y life is so complicated

no even he doesnt

ya

i no

becoz he made human and left hope!!

other chilling question is

?

wat

the afternoon teleserialz

types...justification of 

extra-martial stuff

ohh ya

i mean to say

u bet

shit thats so ick

sick

the scale where u belong

it fluctuates but then wht the 

space u span

hey 

bol

c thats the reason u gotta be choosy while searching for a life partner

but ultimately no one is perfect

so u gotta make compromises

hmm...may be not searching one 

u kno being a philosopher is easy

mm

but making things run as u want (atleast in ur life) is difficult

n impossible

kai zhala

soo may be its a balance

infact they are impossible

ya

cant say

things in life have to be balanced

happiness with sorrow

hmmm but we want only happiness

so things have changed drastically

and simplicity with sophistication

ya kind of

yepz

and music with noise too!!

culture with cranium (brain)

good i m not one of them

sab kuch kaise milega

saab kuch kyoo chahiyee

pura khana kaoo

exactly

pakwaan hi kyoo

rite again

soo what more question one can think off

i mean to ask what more question one can one think of

its not fashionable

hmm soo success matter the most
