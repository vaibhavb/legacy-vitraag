hi Luca,

I have checked the draft of the thesis in the CVS as:
/projects/bubble/cvs/chai-thesis

Currently it is the skeleton of the thesis as we discussed in the last meeting.

All the earlier chai related web-pages are in:
/projects/bubble/dvlab/p/vaibhav/

The mv2rm documentaion is in:
/projects/bubble/dvlab/p/chai/

Lets keep the "chai-thesis cvs" as the communication point. The chapters are:
* Introduction                   ~ 1 page(s)
* Interfaces                     ~ 2
* The Starting Point- Mocha       ~ 5
* Chai                           ~ 15
* Interfaces for hardware design ~ 10

I'm writing the chapter interfaces right now. I have few questions on it which i delve in next email.

regards,
vaibhav
