This file contains the exported function prototype and data
  structure declarations. Currently, there are three different modes of
  simulation: random simulation (the simulator executes all the atoms),
  manual/step simulation (user guides the execution of all the atoms), and
  game simulation (the simulator executes some of the atom, and the user
  controls the others).
