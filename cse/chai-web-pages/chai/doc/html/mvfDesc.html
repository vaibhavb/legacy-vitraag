This package is used to create and manipulate single output
  functions that take multiple values, and are defined over multi-valued
  variables.  Mathematically, such a function is described as, f: Y1 x Y2 x
  ... x Yn --> Yn+1.  Each Yi is a finite, ordered set; if Yi is of
  cardinality k, then the elements of Yi are {0, 1, ..., k-1}. We use yi do
  denote a variable over Yi. If<p>

  A single MDD over variables y1,...,yn cannot be used to represent f, because
  an MDD can only represent binary-valued functions, not multi-valued
  functions.  Instead, to represent f, we use an array of MDDs, of length
  equal to the cardinality of Yn+1.  Each MDD of this array is defined over
  y1,...,yn.  Furthermore, the minterms for which the ith MDD, fi, evaluates
  to one, are exactly those minterms for which f evaluates to the ith member
  of Yn+1.  If f is deterministic, then the intersection of fi and fj, for i
  not equal to j, is empty.  If f is completely specified, then the union of
  the fi's is the tautology.  The union of the fi's is referred to as the
  "domain" of the function.
