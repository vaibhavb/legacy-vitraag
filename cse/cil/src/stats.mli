(** Utilities for maintaining timing statistics *)

(** Reset all the timings *)
val reset : unit -> unit 

(** Time a function and associate the time with the given string. If some
    timing information is already associated with that string, then accumulate
    the times. If this function is invoked within another timed function then
    you can have a hierarchy of timings *)
val time : string -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b 

(** repeattime is like time but runs the function several times until the total
    running time is greater or equal to the first argument. The total time is
    then divided by the number of times the function was run. *)
val repeattime : float -> string -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b

(** Print the current stats preceeded by a message *)
val print : out_channel -> string -> unit
