<h2>Points</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Gc.set { (Gc.get()) with Gc.stack_limit = 16777216 };; (* Up the stack
 size  *)  so that my program doesn't die when occasionally dealing with
longish lists, while being simple and efficient for the common case of short 
ones. Of course, if this balance were different, I might use another data
structure and/or alternative algorithms.</li>
