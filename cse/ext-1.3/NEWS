extdoc NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

Version 1.3 960228

* Added parameter and return type comments to macros as comments that
  appear before arguments and the macro name respectively.

  New Syntax:

  /*Macro****
  ***********/
  #define /* int */ max( /* int */ i /* comment for i */,
			 /* int */ j /* comment for j */ ) 

  Old Syntax:

  /*Macro****
  ***********/
  #define max( i, /* comment for i */
	       j  /* comment for j */ )

* Header files are now listed in the "Maintainer by file" list

Version 1.2 960114

* Restructured extdoc and extindex HTML output to support framesets --
  a new Netscape feature that allows multiple windows within a single
  browser window.

* Added a file-centric display of all functions, called "maintainer
  information sorted by file." 

* Changed the "main" entry points to the HTML documentation.  They are
  now packages.html and command.html.

* Removed distinction between internal and static functions.  They now
  appear along with other internal functions.

* Modified -h -t --html and --text command-line options to allow
  destination directories to be specified, e.g.,

  extdoc --html=/projects/vis/html

* Made pathnames (as opposed to filename) work for extdoc and
  extproto.  Both now accept full pathnames as arguments and read and
  write files in the "right" subdirectories.

* Fixed bug where extproto would add an extra newline to the end of
  automatically-generated header files.

Version 1.1 951101

* Added HTML documentation, htmltoman converter for generating
  nroff-style man pages.
