The ext system is a set of programs that generate documentation for
the World-Wide Web from specially-formatted C programs and
automatically place function prototypes in header files.  These are
being used in a variety of large software projects and have been shown
to simplify the programmer's task.

It requires the public-domain scripting language perl be installed on your
system.  The latest version of perl can be had from

ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/

Installation is simple.  In this directory, type

./configure
make
make install

By default, this will install extdoc, extproto, and extindex in
/usr/local/bin, and manual pages for these in /usr/local/man/man1.  To
install them elsewhere, e.g., in /usr/local/share/bin and
/usr/local/share/man, run configure with the --prefix option:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local/share

For more detailed installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.

Documentation on the ext system (in HTML) can be found in the doc/
subdirectory, which is not installed by "make install."

Templates for the structured comments can be found in the templates/
directory.

The emacs lisp file "ext.el," generated automatically, adds bindings
to the C mode that adds templates for the structured comments the ext
system requires.
