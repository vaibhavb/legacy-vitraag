<h1>Naming Conventions</h1>

<hr>

This discusses the conventions for naming functions, macros,
structures, and variables within the <tt>ext</tt> environment.  The
objective of these conventions is for a name to be canonical and to
completely identify its type and scope.  Adhering to these conventions
is necessary for the <tt>ext</tt> tools to work. <p>

When names are longer than one English word, the words are catenated
and their first letters capitalized, e.g., <tt>ThisIsALongExample</tt>.
This is shorter than other styles, and is at least as readable. <P>

The environment defines three scopes, each of which has its own naming
convention: <P>

<UL>

<LI> External: features visible outside the package.  Names are
     prefixed with ``<i>package</i><tt>_</tt>''. <P>

<LI> Internal: features not visible outside, but visible throughout
     the package.  Names are prefixed with ``<i>package</i>''. <P>

<LI> Local: features visible only within a single file or function.
     Names have no package prefix. <P>

</UL>

Functions and macros, variables, and structures each have their own
naming convention: <P>

<UL>

<LI> Functions/Macros: The package name and the first word of
     the rest of the name are both capitalized. <P>
 
     The words in a function name are arranged in an English sentence-like
     order:  <P>

  <OL>
  <LI> First word: Name of the object being operated on: the subject of
       the sentence (e.g., <tt>Range</tt>, <tt>Network</tt>). <P>

  <LI> Second word: The action being performed on the object: the verb
       of the sentence (e.g., <tt>Read</tt>, <tt>Obtain</tt>,
       <tt>Alloc</tt>).  <tt>Obtain</tt> is used for functions that
       return a pointer to a copy of a data structure that must later
       be freed be the caller.  <tt>Read</tt> is used for all other
       cases.  <tt>Get</tt> should not be used. <P>

  <LI> Third and successive words: Modifiers: the object of the
       sentence (e.g., <tt>States</tt>, <tt>RightChild</tt>,
       <tt>BddIdArrayFromMddId</tt>) <P>

  </OL>

<LI> Variables: The package name is lowercase.  The first word
     of the rest of name is lowercase except for internal variables. <P>

<LI> Structures: Type definitions for these have the package name and
     the first word is capitalized, and the name has a <tt>_t</tt> suffix. <P>

<LI> Constants: All letters are capitalized; all words are separated
     by underlines (``<tt>_</tt>''). <P>

<LI> Enumerations: Type definitions for these have the package name
     and the first word capitalized, and the name as a <tt>_c</tt> suffix. <P>

</UL>

The table below gives examples of names. <P>
