<div class="Section1">  
<p class="MsoNormal">Dear Tai,<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">Hope you are in a mood to read a long mail. Get some
tea (<span class="SpellE">i</span> finished mine <span class="GramE">today:</span>(
) and make sure your are in alone in a reflective mood and have half an hour
at hand to read it through end. Or else read on later. Seems like a computer
algorithm!! It took me weeks to think about this mail and a couple of days
to write. So it may be a bit philosophical and involved. But the sole aim
is to start a dialog and communicate. <o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">I intend to try and answer few questions with your help.
<span class="SpellE">Afterall</span> we have been buddies growing together
;) and share a natural bond of love and support. These questions have always
haunted me.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="color: red;">Q1. Vibha ke future
plans kya hai?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">A big question right. After all this education and exposure, 
what do I intend to do. My dream has been to do a start-up company. I possess 
the required technical and management skills, but still it’s not that straight 
forward to me. This is because I intend to make a product which makes a difference
where it’s most required. I want to add value where it’s most essential.
I don’t just want to make some stereotype company or say business. <o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">I'm a very passionate person and I should care a lot
for whatever I do. All my buddies are aware of this. For instance in college
I didn't work for a society IEEE (supposed to be international engineer’s
society and all people what to have it spelled on there resume). I withdrew
my application for the secretary post and worked for some other dying computer 
society -CSI. Simply because I didn't want to have an easy route to success
;) and wanted to make a difference.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">I don’t know but people have said that I seem to be
very ambitious. But I don’t think so, I am happy with nothing at all. But
when I work I want to work for a valid cause and more so passion, which people
kind of evade. So success has always been difficult but not impossible for
me. I have fought for causes. In hostel there was a division between gujarathis
and marwadis. I was a guy with both having gujju and maru friends. When I
became the GS there was a controversy created by people favoring divisions;
on the magazine which I had made (saransh). I was furious over the division
and dirty politics and fought all alone with the team of chors to see to
it that things get done. In the process there was lot of bitterness but people
who struck by my side knew that I intended something good.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">So what has all this got to do with what I will do in
future? Even I don’t know but the fact is I love to work on seemingly impossible
tasks. So may be it will be some technology or social issue. But I intend
to work on worthy things, which can make a difference.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="color: red;">Q2. <span
 class="GramE">Beta Wapiis ayega ke nahi?</span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">This leads us to another issue, will I come back to
<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Well
a simple answer to this difficult question is "yes"; I have been a hardcore
Indian ;) and would like to make a difference to country which made me. But
when is a question and how is even a bigger question.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">Actually it has been a long time I have been away from
home. You know we have missed a lot!<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="color: red;">Q3. <span
 class="GramE">Beta wahi shaadi tu nahi kar lega?</span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">Shaadi <span class="GramE">ko</span> phir bhi time hai
lekin valid question. After the Pawan episode I thought of putting this as
question one but resisted the change.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">Hmmm...so what do you think I will do?? You know all
these decisions are so dependant on situations. I sure you understand the
bond of culture we have which makes us to take decisions which wont spoil
or mar the good things which we were fortunate to inherit. This is what might
have made you stick with your decision to choose a life partner. I don’t
underestimate the fear of community but that is secondary and not valid in
case of people who are mature enough to take decisions.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">So what it that we are fortunate enough to inherit and
want to treasure all our life’s. The first thing on my list is a closely
knit family, where each person knows how difficult it has been for us to
fight out and achieve some success from relatively not so easy situations.
The bond of each others existence to support in whatever failure is what
we cant afford to lose. This makes me all the more worried about whether
I will be able to give my parents a good life and keep them happy. I talk
more about it in a later question. <o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">The other thing which we cant afford to lose is the
gift of Jainism. I have very strong feeling about Jainism. In US there is
a concept that you choose your religion. That is you are not born with some
religion. Majority of urban americans don’t have a religion and that for
a valid reason. Its better not to have a religion when one sees that majority
of problems in the world have been created by religion. I take religion as
very individual thing. But if you kindaa jus think over what being a jain
implies (in true sense). Its that very individuality. May be this is a bit
abstract but anyways its great sense of self-existence. I mostly still practice
eating jain food and occasionally (sometimes regularly doing samvar). I have
always treasured what mom has given us. Its something one might take a life-time
to find out. So, in short Jainism (read not the popular one) is to treasure.
So may be more about Jainism sometime later.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">Some other things which should be lost I summarize as
Indian Culture. Though it doesn't exists in modern <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
anymore. Things like respect for things which make our living possible: water, 
energy, teacher and elders. Its like respecting materials more than there
money worth!! Its kind of not being too much materialistic.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="color: red;">Q4. Does beta
have anyone in mind at this time and does he care for arranged marriage?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">Hmmm<span class="GramE">..</span>do I ;). I'm pretty
choosy so it will take sometime for someone to be in mind;). I'm a pretty
social guy and have friends who are girls and some are really good friends.
Even they feel that I’m a very difficult person ;). Coming to point of friends
I treasure them. One should always be up-to-date with friendship "<st1:place>kama</st1:place> 
purta mama" doesn't help much. Business relations are different on the other
side.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">So, do I care about arranged marriage. I'm certainly
not against arranged marriage. Actually they have done a pretty decent job
until recently. The idea is to find a person who I more probable to be good
fit for you and your family,<span style="">  </span>its not about the way
you find it. Arranged marriage served a good role when the family knows more
about the good fit than the subject. They certainly are best in such cases.
It tends to fail in cases where the wavelengths start differing.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">A better question is about caste or religion. Our country 
seems to segregate the likes and unlikes on this basis. So many cases this
is a good thing to go with. But again its upon the perception of individuals.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">To say succinctly like any other highly educated (?)
person its nice to be open about who your life partner will be but I also
want to make sure what it will be like for my family and about things which
I want to preserve.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">But n e ways this is the only time I thought about it,
soo its very premature. Remember my dream!!!<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="color: red;">Q5. Beta strange
hai!!! Why doesn't he do simple things and earn money which he can. Why are
his soo called dreams or conditions so strong. Why doesn't he think like
everyone <span class="GramE">does.</span> Why does he want to care for things
he may/may not help <span class="GramE">better</span>. Why does it <span
 class="GramE">has</span> to be hard way, will he give away or stick?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">--&gt;All questions are highly unanswerable. It will
the support of family and situations which will help me stick on or give
away to a more mundane life.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">You know what is my fear in life. Suppose due to my
stupid view, I’m not able to succeed (as in make sufficient money) in life
and give a good life to my parents. May be if my dear ones know that I made
a sincere attempt it wont be that bad.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">You'll say we will be besides u in u r good and bad
times..u kno thats all said<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">no matter wat...but the basic needs of life make all
fundas baseless. No doubt you will but?? Life is not easy at all...esp if
u r a professional person..ppl expect lottttt frm u isnt it. But you kno
i always feel that if i cant make a difference then no pt. but u kno one
has to have a solid base ...to speak all this stuff. Life is kinda of a balance
becoz of basic human needs and expectations.<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="color: red;">Q6. Another chilling
question not of much relevance but still significance is morality. Especially
sexual morality, especially when one has to deal with the effects and aftermaths
of westernized </span></b><st1:country-region><st1:place><b style=""><span
 style="color: red;">India</span></b></st1:place></st1:country-region><b
 style=""><span style="color: red;">.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">--&gt; Maybe here is where our growing-up makes the difference!!!!<o:p></o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
  
<p class="MsoNormal">While writing all this i learnt so much about myself
and i expect to learn more from your response.<o:p></o:p></p>
