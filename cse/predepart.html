Getting the Visa :
--------------------
  
 For students with full financial aid this is no problem at all.
 Even then these tips will make it all the more peaceful.
 o When you go for the visa dress decently. Avoid any Americanisms.
 A touch of Indianism helps a lot (e.g. a streak of "Vibuthi" on the
 forehead). Speak slowly and clearly. Don't appear tense and don't look
 desperate. Showing self-confidence helps.
 o Go along with a friend having a vehicle (just in case you have
 to go & get something)
 o They should never feel that you will have any sort of difficulty
 language, finance, racial, religious, etc.
  
 o You should be able to convince them that you will come back to
 India. If they ask you, points in favor are : a) only child,
 b)	immovable property in India (can take a proof document),
 c)	orthodox family, 
 d) brought up in rural atmosphere, e) lots of relatives
 in India; none abroad, f) mom, dad won't come to USA, g) field of interest
 not available in India, h) change of field not possible in India, i)
 interest in teaching - get PhD fast.
  
 Actually all this won't be required - just in case they decide to have an
 interview with you these tips will come in handy.
 o Suggested ideal timings for getting the visa :
 to apply - 9:45 to 10:00 A.M.
 to collect - 4:45 to 5:00 P.M.
  
 o Do not go at 5:00 A.M. in the morning & wait
 o Avoid Mondays and Fridays, Wednesdays are preferable
 o Go sometime before and get the form for this (you can take the 
 filled form)
 o Things to be taken with you when you go for the visa
 a)	signed I-20 form
 b)	filled visa application form
 c)	two passport size photos (take some glue)
 d)	passport
 e)	admission & aid letters
 f)	TOEFL & GRE scores (original + photocopy)
 g)	Xerox copy of grade cards
  

Traveling Tips for Students:
------------------------------  
 Block your tickets well in advance(this implies no financial
 commitment). This can be done via travel agents. Make sure the Travel Agent
 is good (examples of dependable travel agents are - Travel Corporation of
 India (TCI), Parrys Travels).
 //92 - All India Travel Agency (AITA)
 Block flights with many airlines/agencies. Put pressure on the agencies and
 get as much info as possible. Much before the flight call the airlines
 themselves and confirm your ticket.
 // 92 - Indicate whether you want Asian Vegetarian Meal (AVM),
 non-smoking section, etc
 o Cross-check everything the travel agent says
 o Some airlines offer Frequent Flier programs (e.g. Air France,
 TWA) [i.e. after a certain # of miles of flying with that airline you get a
 free ticket]. Enroll in such programs.
 // 92 - Delta, British Airways ?
 o Avoid change of airline. A direct flight is the best. If change
 of airline can't be avoided, leave at least 4-6 hrs gap between the
 scheduled arrival of one flight and the scheduled departure of the
 connecting flight.
 o Baggage is usually safe with a single airline - change of
 airline sometimes leads to misplaced luggage. Some airlines don't take care
 of baggage transfer - you may have to personally carry it (check this while
 booking)
  
 
 Getting permit for $750
 -----------------------
  
 This can be got from any bank authorised to do so (need not go to RBI for
 this). You can get this within a month of the date of the flight.
 The following documents have to be taken along to get the permit :
 Passport + copy, air ticket, I-20 stident copy + copy, grade cards + copies,
 PC + copy, XII std pass/mark sheet + copy, aid & admission letters + copies,
 bank advance/ any other form of payment.
 You may take part of the $750 in currency notes - upto $50 is okay (legally
 upto $100 allowed)
 
 
 Things to be done in advance:
-------------------------------
  
 Certain things have to be done in advance, i.e., as soon as you get your aid
 - much before the flight.
 o Learn typing
 o Learn driving
 o Learn to cook
 o apply for bank loan (if necessary)
 o make your passport valid for 6 months more than your stay 
 indicated in your I-20
 // 92 - make sure your passport is valid for 6 months atleast.
 All other changes are best made in the U.S.
 o make outstation purchases (sweater, thermal underwear, cassettes,
 etc. - available/cheap in Delhi, Bombay ...)
 o get medical checkup done
 a)	dental
 b)	fresh checkup, especially if you have a major ailment
  
 Get prescriptions & medicines for all common ailments (the technical name of
 the medicine along with Indian/US brand name).  See Appendix I.
 c)	get your eye-sight checked - get a new prescription. Buy atleast one
 extra pair of glasses.
 d)	get tested for TB if possible (chest X-ray) - 
else they will do it at the
 Univ
 e)	get requisite immunization done (especially MMR)
  
 o get cassettes recorded which you may like to take with you
 o write to the India club/OIPS giving your flight #, time & date
 of arrival; they may pick you up & give temporary accomodation
 if necessary
 o if you are very interested in any Indian magazine (Gult, Tamil,
 etc.) subscribe to them - you can subscribe to them after going to the US also.
 o note your/parent's bank A/c #
  
 
 Packing
 -------
  
 o Start your packing well in advance
 o Buy two good boxes - they should be able to withstand a lot of 
 mishandling. They should be as large as possible within the size limitations
 (however most airlines are not very strict about baggage size). Put
 identification marks and labels both inside & outside the boxes (apart from
 this the airlines will also provide you with adhesive labels). Boxes with
 independent top & bottom are preferable.
 o Box specifications
 As an example the Air India economy class baggage specifications to the USA
 are given below. Note the specs. may be different for other countries/airlines.
 2 pieces of baggage with total linear dimension (l+b+h) not
 exceeding 270cm (106"). Moreover the total linear dimension
 of each piece should not be over 158cm (62"). The weight of
 each bag should not exceed 32kg (70lb) [note: they are not
 particular about this]
 Carry on baggage : In addition you can carry a bag with linear dimension not
 exceeding 115cm (45") onboard (fits beneath the seat).
 For most other airlines the baggage spec.s are similar (confirm)
 If you are taking a break outside USA/Canada contact your travel agent or
 airlines for details.
 
  
 Clothes
 -------
  
 Usually clothes are machine washed once a week (laundramat) - hence one week
 supply of clothes (+ one week backup) is needed.  Get all clothes little
 loose - clothes may shrink in machine wash & you will probably grow fatter.
 o 14-15 sets of undergarments, socks, handkerchiefs
 //92 - Not necessary ! Good stuff available here & pretty cheap
 o 5 sets of good shirts, pants
 o a good swimming trunk + few shorts
 o a tie + 1-2 belts
 o 3-6 ordinary towels (Turkish ones start stinking)
 o a bedsheet
 o lungies/dhotis/pajamas
 o thermal underwear (2-4)
 o extra woollen sweaters
 Note:
 o sleeveless woollen sweaters are enough for warm places
 o woollen socks not recommended if not going to a cold place
 o second hand alarm clocks are cheap in US
 o don't take Indian files (empty) or punching machines - filing
 system is different in the US (3 holes, A4)
 o don't take paper
 o don't take raincoats
 o don't buy purse (wallet for carrying cards can be bought in US)
 o wear your shoes to save space in the box. If needed buy only
 leather shoes (other types of shoes are cheap in US). For some weather
 conditions Indian leather shoes may crack.
 // 92 - don't worry yourself if you can't bring any of the
 stuff listed above - most of them are available pretty cheap in the US
 (made in China). Exceptions are leather goods, formal wear. 
In a month or two you will be in a position to get anything you want 
(unless you are not on aid).
 
 
 
 Food stuffs
 -----------
  
 Below are some South Indian food stuffs that may be taken :
 o 1 - 2.5 kg packets of "Sambar Podi"
 o 1 packet of "Rasam podi"
 o 0.5 box of "Masala podi"
 o 1 box of "Paruppu podi", "Upma podi", "Vatha-kozhambu podi",
 "tamarind rice podi"
 o Appalam/Vadam/pickles
 o mustard packet
 o tamarind paste
 o different dhals in small quantity for initial phase
 o asafoetida powder
 o Indian instant coffee + Indian tea (takes some time to get
 used to American stuff)
 o Elaichi, clove, cinnamon
 Note: most of these items are available in the Indian stores in
 the major cities. However you need to carry them for use in the first few days.
 o actually pickles are not allowed - but you can take them in
 solder-sealed tins. [students are usually not checked for these]
 o take all dry food stuff in sealed plastic packets
 // 92 - Most Indian foodstuffs are available even in small
 cities. Don't come loaded with foodstuffs as you may have (small) problems
 with the customs. Try to get "instant" stuff as people generally don't have
 much time for cooking in the US.
 
 
 Vessels
 -------
  
 o big pressure pan (with spare handle, 3 safety valves, 2 weights,
 1 base plate, 3 gaskets) [note: big pressure cooker may not be
 needed as rice cooker can be bought in the US]
 o idli plates
 o dosai turner, charani (server with holes), rice server & other
 servers
 o tongs
 o small bowls ("kinnum")
 o rolling pin
 o knife
 o kadaie (optional)
 o cook book - e.g. "Cook & See" by Meenakshi Ammal
 Note: no other vessels needed. No tumblers needed. Try to share & bring the
 vessels with others coming to your Univ. Non-stick kitchenware is cheap in
 the US. and you can buy a full set.

 On the day of the flight & in-flight + later
 --------------------------------------------
  
 o since it is going to be a long flight wear something comfortable
 (cotton dress + full hand shirt). Wear your shoes - inflight
 you can remove them (some airlines give inflight shoes - else relax in socks)
 o be at the airport 3-4 hours before flight departure
 o collect $20 at the airport (part of it in $1)
 o relax during flight, sleep as much as possible
 o for vegetarians - watch out before you eat - you may get non-veg
 even if you had asked for veg. Veg. food is generally bland - fruits/juice
 are good choices. (Before ordering anything on board check if you have to
 pay for it separately for it). Don't hesitate to ask questions.
 o once out of India be very careful (from sheer experience of
 seniors). Don't trust anyone. Don't hire a taxi (unless emergency) till you
 reach your destination. If required don't hesitate to spend money.
 // 92 - Don't hesitate to talk to people to ask questions -
 usually they will answer all your queries properly.
 
 
 Port of entry procedures
 ------------------------
  
 o sometime before landing the flight attendant will distribute
 customs declaration forms & immigration forms as mentioned below. Fill these
 out on the plane (you will submit them to the appropriate authorities when
 you land). Do not hesitate to take the flight attendant's help.
 // 92 - You can indicate that you have nothing to declare &
 total value of all your things is less than $100 on the
 customs form
 Form I-94 - fill in the plane. After seeing your documents immigration
 officer will indicate length of stay, Univ, etc.  This will be attached to
 your passport. Important: note the expiry date and D/S (duration of status).
 Form I-20 ID copy - all transactions regarding your non-immigrant status
 will be recorded in this form. This should be retained at all times (not
 surrendered when you temporarily leave the US). Your admission number will
 be given - memorize it & note it elsewhere.
 o just before you land the correct local time will be announced
 set your watch [dual time watch will come in handy here]
  
 o once you are out of the plane go straight to the immigration
 counter - rush for them to beat the queue. It might take 0.5-1 hour here.
 Keep your I-20, passport, admission & aid letters ready. They might ask a
 few questions like - is this your first time in the US ? Student ? F-1 visa
 ? Which Univ ?  They will attach an I-64 card to your visa.
 You are now in the USA !
 o then go to the baggage are to fetch your luggage. Pick up a
 cart (you get this at a machine for $1) to carry the bags.  Then pick up
 your bags as they come out on the conveyor (suitable eye-catching labels
 help here). If you don't get your baggage inform the enquiry section - you
 may have to wait 0.5-1 hour here.
 o cart your baggage to nearby Customs. If asked tell them that
 you are a student, F-1 visa, school, dept., coming to US for 
 the first time
 If asked to open the baggage do so slowly - do not mess up the place.
 If asked about the "podi"s tell them that they are "dried Indian spices" to
 make traditional Indian food like curry.  Rarely they might ask you to go to
 the agris. dept. nearby - that is a pain.
 If asked about "vibuthi" tell them that it is holy Hindu powder used for prayer.
 Note : In most cases you will NOT be asked to open your boxes
 at all & will be simply waved through.
 o now go & wait at the nearest exit for the guys who are supposed
 to pick you up. If nobody turns up after some time (say 0.5 hour) make a
 collect call (at the public phone dial a '0', get the operator & ask for a
 collect call).
 Else call i) your Prof ii) dept. iii)International Students' Office iv)
 admissions office v) any Indian guy in the directory Go & ask for an
 announcement to be made over the PA system.  Get a card, write your name &
 hold it up.
 o Never leave your baggage unattended. Don't go out of the airport
 until somebody comes & picks you up. If you have doubts about
 the guy who comes to pick you up, don't hesitate to ask for
 his ID. [All this is of course being a little extra cautious]
 o Once you reach your friend's house (or other destination) call
 home & inform them of reaching safely. Keep a readymade card - add a few
 lines - go to the nearest post office, get stamps & mail the card immediately.
 
 
 A few things of importance after arrival in US
 -----------------------------------------------
  
 o Your first work is to meet the Foreign Students' Advisor in
 the International Student Office (ISO). They keep a record of you (passport,
 visa details etc). When you leave the US (temporarily or permanently) you
 have to go there again.
 Then do the things which you did when you entered IITM -
 get your Univ ID card
 get your Driver's Licence
 tax forms, etc some paperwork in the dept.
 meet the HOD/grad. student advisor/advisor
 register for classes
  
 Be happy now that your dream has come true !
