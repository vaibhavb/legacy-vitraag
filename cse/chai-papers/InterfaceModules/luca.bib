{	In order to detect potential timing problems caused by small
   deviations of the internal delays in a VLSI circuit, a delay model is
   proposed in which the sizes of the delays are bounded by lower and upper
   bounds. We then introduce a race model, called the extended bounded delay
   (XBD) model, is presented, that can be used to predict the behavior of a
   circuit when the circuit is started in a stable state and some inputs
   change. The XBD race model is continuous and computationally intractable. A
   description is also given of an efficient algorithm, called the ternary
   bounded delay (TBD) algorithm, and it is shown that the results of this
   algorithm exactly summarize the behavior of the network according to the XBD
   race model. The author has implemented the TBD algorithm in the COSMOS
   switch-level simulator, and early results show that the overhead is small
   compared with standard unit delay simulation.

   "The temporal logic model algorithm of E.M. Clarke et al. (ACM Trans.
   Prog. Lang. Syst., vol.8, no.2, p.244-63, 1986) is modified to represent a
   state graph using binary decision diagrams (BDDs). Because this
   representation captures some of the regularity in the state space of
   sequential circuits with data path logic, one is able to verify circuits
   with an extremely large number of states. This new technique is demonstrated
   on a synchronous pipelined design with approximately 5*10/sup 20/ states.
   The logic that is used to specify circuits is a propositional temporal logic
   of branching time, called CTL or Computation Tree Logic. The model checking
   algorithm handles full CTL with fairness constraints. Consequently. it is
   possible to handle a number of important liveness and fairness properties.
   which would otherwise not be expressible in CTL. The method presented is not
   necessarily a replacement for brute-force state-enumeration methods but an
   alternative that may work efficiently when the brute force methods fail."

   logic expressing user-supplied questions about the system behavior with

   if the system model satisfies each of the assertions and provides a
   counterexample to locate the error if one exists. Temporal logic is used for

   treated in a style similar to, but more general than, Martin-Lof's system of
   arities. The treatment of rules and proofs focuses on his notion of a 
   judgement. Logics are represented in LF via a new principle, the judgments 
   as types principle, whereby each judgment is identified with the type of its
   proofs. This allows for a smooth treatment of discharge and variable 
   occurrence conditions and leads to a uniform treatment of rules and proofs 
   whereby rules are viewed as proofs of higher-order judgments and proof 
   checking is reduced to type checking. The practical benefit of the treatment
   of forma. systems is that logic-independent tools, such as proof editors and
   proof checkers can be constructed."

   commercial simulators rarely provide such facilities; in fact, the
   simulators usually assume that all the gate delays are exactly equal. In
   contrast to this, binary race analysis frequently assumes that gate delays
   can be arbitrarily large, though finite. An exception to this is the
   almost-equal-delay race model, where gates have different delays, but the
   difference between any two delays cannot be arbitrary. The difficulty with
   the use of this model is that it is computationally very inefficient. In
   this paper the authors define a new ternary model which is very closely
   related to the binary almost-equal-delay model. Moreover, the ternary model
   is considerably more efficient, as efficient as the unit delay model;
   consequently, it could easily be incorporated in simulators."

	"Fault-free digital circuits that can malfunction when asynchronous 
   inputs have critical timing combinations resulting in metastable operation 
   are considered. This mode of failure is often overlooked in digital system 
   design and reliability analysis. The authors survey developments in the 
   study of metastable behavior and identify their relevance to digital system 
   design and reliability. They describe and evaluate a number of techniques 
   for reducing the probability of metastable failure, including the use of 
   fast devices, extended decision time, a pausable clock, a Schmitt 
   synchronizer, and redundancy and masking. They show that the use of extended
   decision time is the best technique for lowering the probability of 
   synchronization failure."

           designer of an embedded, real-time system to reason about
           and calculate whether a given requirement will hold with a
           sufficient high probability for given failure probabilities
           for components used in the design of the system. The main
           idea is to specify requirements and design in Duration
           Calculus, a real-time, interval logic, to define
           satisfaction probabilities for formulas in this calculus,
           and establish a calculus with rules that support
           calculation of the probability for a composite formula from
           probabilities of its constituents. This ensures that
           reasoning about probabilities is consistent with
           requirements and design decisions. We thus avoid
           introducing separate models for requirements and
           reliability analysis. The system model is a finite
           automaton with fixed transition probabilities. This defines
           discrete Markov processes as basis for the
           calulus. Keywords: duration calculus, real-time systems,
           probabilistic automata, satisfaction probability."
