Fair CTL model checker and debugger.  Works on a flattened   network.

mdd_t *
Mc_FormulaEvaluate(
  Sym_Info_t *      symInfo,
  Atlp_Formula_t *  formula,
  Mc_VerbosityLevel verbosity
)
  This function is called by McModelCheck to evaluate the ATL formula.

boolean
Mc_FormulaSemanticCheck(
  Atlp_Formula_t *  formula,
  Mdl_Module_t *    module,
  Var_TypeManager_t typeManager
)
  Given a formula, this function will check its semantic against the specified
  module. The following will be checked: 1. whether the variables appear in
  the formula also appears in the module; 2. type of the formula (a type
  checking routine similar to the typechecking in atm package is used); 3. for
  formula with path quantifer, check if the formula's agents are refering to
  the correct ATOMS. For the atomic formulas (formulas with type Atlp_LT_c,
  Atlp_LE_c, Atlp_GE_c, Atlp_GT_c, Atlp_EQ_c), an Atm_Expr_t is built and
  stored in the atmExpr field of the formula. This will later be used to
  compute the set of states in Mc_FormulaEvaluate.

  Side Effects: It is an error to call this function, if the formula has type
  Atlp_PLUS_c, Atlp_MINUS_c, Atlp_UMINUS or Atlp_NATNUM_c, since these formula
  do not evaluate to boolean type.

int
Mc_Init(
  Tcl_Interp *      interp,
  Main_Manager_t *  manager
)
  Called by TclAppInit for initialization of package. It also calls Atlp_Init
  to initialize the formula parsing package. Moreover, it creates the command
  mc for model-checking.
