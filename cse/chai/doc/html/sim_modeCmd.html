<code>sim_mode [-hsun] &lt;module&gt; [&lt;component&gt; ...] CommandDescription [This routine changes the mode of simulation. Note that the mode of simulation can only be changed at the begining of a round. Thus if the user wants to change the mode, say from game simulation to random simulation, the user has to complete the current round before making the change. <p> For command options, see the command documentation for sim_start.</code><p>
