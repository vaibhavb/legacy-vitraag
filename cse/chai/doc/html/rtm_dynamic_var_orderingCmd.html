<h3>rtm_dynamic_var_ordering - control the application of dynamic variable ordering</h3>
<hr>
<code>rtm_dynamic_var_ordering [-d] [-e &lt;method&gt;] [-f &lt;method&gt;] [-h]</code><p>
Control the application of dynamic variable ordering. Dynamic ordering is a 
  technique to reorder the MDD variables to reduce the size of the existing MDDs.  When no options
  are specified, the current status of dynamic ordering is displayed.  At most one
  of the options -e, -f, and -d should be specified. 

  Dynamic ordering may be time consuming, but can often reduce the size of the
  MDDs dramatically.
  
  Command options:<p>  

  <dl>

  <dt> -d
  <dd> Disable dynamic ordering from triggering automatically.<p>
  
  <dt> -e &lt;method&gt;
  <dd> Enable dynamic ordering to trigger automatically whenever a certain
  threshold on the overall MDD size is reached. "Method" must be one of the following:<p>

  <b>window:</b> Permutes the variables within windows of three adjacent
  variables so as to minimize the overall MDD size.  This process is repeated
  until no more reduction in size occurs.<p>

  <b>sift:</b> Moves each variable throughout the order to find an optimal
  position for that variable (assuming all other variables are fixed).  This
  generally achieves greater size reductions than the window method, but is
  slower.<p>
  
  <b>The following methods are only available if MOCHA has been linked with the
  Bdd package from the University of Colorado (cuBdd).</b><p>

  <b>random:</b> Pairs of variables are randomly chosen, and swapped in the
  order. The swap is performed by a series of swaps of adjacent variables. The
  best order among those obtained by the series of swaps is retained. The
  number of pairs chosen for swapping equals the number of variables in the
  diagram.<p>

  <b>random_pivot:</b> Same as <b>random<b>, but the two variables are chosen
  so that the first is above the variable with the largest number of nodes, and
  the second is below that variable.  In case there are several variables tied
  for the maximum number of nodes, the one closest to the root is used.<p>

  <b>sift_converge:</b> The <b>sift<b> method is iterated until no further
  improvement is obtained.<p>

  <b>symmetry_sift:</b> This method is an implementation of symmetric
  sifting. It is similar to sifting, with one addition: Variables that become
  adjacent during sifting are tested for symmetry. If they are symmetric, they
  are linked in a group. Sifting then continues with a group being moved,
  instead of a single variable.<p>

  <b>symmetry_sift_converge:</b> The <b>symmetry_sift<b> method is iterated
  until no further improvement is obtained.<p>

  <b>window{2,3,4}:</b> Permutes the variables within windows of n adjacent
  variables, where "n" can be either 2, 3 or 4, so as to minimize the overall
  MDD size.<p>

  <b>window{2,3,4}_converge:</b> The <b>window{2,3,4}<b> method is iterated
  until no further improvement is obtained.<p>

  <b>group_sift:</b> This method is similar to <b>symmetry_sift</b>,
  but uses more general criteria to create groups.

  <b>group_sift_converge:</b> The <b>group_sift<b> method is iterated until no
  further improvement is obtained.<p>

  <b>annealing:</b> This method is an implementation of simulated annealing for
  variable ordering. This method is potentially very slow.<p>

  <b>genetic:</b> This method is an implementation of a genetic algorithm for
  variable ordering. This method is potentially very slow.<p>

  <dt> -f &lt;method&gt;
  <dd> Force dynamic ordering to be invoked immediately.  The values for
  method are the same as in option -e.<p>

  <dt> -h
  <dd> Print the command usage.
