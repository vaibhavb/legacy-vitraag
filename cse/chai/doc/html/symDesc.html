This package contains routines to build the symbolic transition
               relation for a module. The task of building the transition
               relation has two main components:
               1. Selecting a good variable ordering for the BDD package.
               2. Parititioning the transition relation
               Currently, simple heuristics are used to do both these tasks.
               Variable ordering is based on the topological order
               generated by the module manager. Based on conventional wisdom,
               we keep the "present" and "next" pairs together for each
               variable.
               The partitioning is conjunctive, with each conjunct
               representing the transition relation for an atom.

               Restrictions:
               Currently, the next operator is not
               supported.
