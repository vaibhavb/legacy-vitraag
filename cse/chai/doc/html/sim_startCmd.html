<h3>sim_start - start simulation for module</h3>
<hr>
<code>sim_start [-hsun] &lt;module&gt; [&lt;component&gt; ...]</code><p>
This command starts and initialize simulation of the
  specified module.  There are three modes of simulations: random, manual and
  game simulation.  In general, user also specify the components that are
  controlled by the user to start a game simulation. For random and manual
  simulations which are two extreme cases of game simulation, there is no need
  to specify the components: for random simulation, all components are
  controlled by the system, while in manual simulation, all are controlled by
  the user. <p>

  Command options: <p>

  <dl>
  <dt> -h
  <dd> Prints usage.

  <dt> -s
  <dd> Specify that the specified components are controlled by the system.
  If no component is specified, the simulation is the same as manual
  simulation (no component is controlled by the system).

  <dt> -u
  <dd> Specify that the specified components are controlled by the user.
  If no component is specified, the simulation is the same as random
  simulation (no component is controlled by the user).  This is the default
  option. 

  <dt> -n
  <dd> Specify that the component names given are actually atom names. It is
  illegal to mix both sub-module names and atom names. Without this option,
  the component names are assumed to be sub-module names.
  
  <dt> &lt;component&gt ... ;
  <dd> Names of the sub-modules that are controlled by the user (system in the
  case of -s is specified). If -n is used, the names are atom names.
