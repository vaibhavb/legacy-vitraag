<h3>sim_info - Provides miscellaneous information about the current simulation.</h3>
<hr>
<code>sim_info [-h] &lt;module&gt; &lt;option&gt;</code><p>
This command returns miscellaneous information about
  current simulation of the specified module, depending on the option
  supplied. <p>

  Command options:<p>

  <dl>
  <dt> -h
  <dd> Prints usage.

  <dt> &lt;option&gt;
  <dd> option can be one of the following keyword:

  <p>
  <dl>
  <dt> isStartOfRound
  <dd> Returns 1 if the simulation is at the start of a round, and 0
  otherwise.

  <p>
  <dt> isEndOfRound
  <dd> Returns 1 if the current round has just finished, and 0
  otherwise. Usually if the simulation is at the end of a round, it is also at
  the start of the round and vice versa. But there is a subtlety: at the start
  of the initial round, isStartOfRound will return 1, but isEndOfRound will
  return 0.

  <p>
  <dt> atomOrdering
  <dd> Returns a linear order of the atoms. The sub-rounds of execution are
  carried according to this order.
  
  <p>
  <dt> variableOrdering
  <dd> Returns a linear order of the variables. Variables controlled by the
  same atoms are grouped together.
  
  <p>
  <dt> isUserTurn
  <dd> Returns 1 if it is the user's turn during the simulation, and 0
  otherwise. 
  
  <p>
  <dt> isInitialRound
  <dd> Returns 1 if the current round is the initial round, and 0 otherwise.
  
  <p>
  <dt> mode
  <dd> Returns the mode of the current simulation. The result is "random",
  "manual" or "game".
  
  <p>
  <dt> isSimulated
  <dd> Returns 1 if the module is being simulated, 0 otherwise.
  
  </dl>
