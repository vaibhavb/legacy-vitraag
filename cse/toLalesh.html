<pre wrap="">Dear vaibhav, how r.u<br>After a long time we are having communication, Hope this e-mail finds u in  pink of ur health.<br>Since long time  I am hearing regarding ur future plans from vaishali &amp; other family members. But before taking the final decision just think over it.<br>1) Financial aspect:<br>I know u r thinking in the terms of emotions &amp; family responsibility. I feell u can fulfill them in better ways by staying abroad &amp; having some handsome salary job. In practical life only emotions doesn&acirc;&#8364;&#8482;t count . U  need to have  money in ur hand but also u need to keep that flow in constant. This is because as money comes in ur hand  not only ur need increases but also increases maintainence cost &amp; money to keep ur increasing expectations. U may not agree with me but believe this is the fact.<br>U can also get a  job in India but that will not pay as much as that of USA. This has manifold aspects. See the job in USA will give u<br>-	handsome money ( At least 10 times than India).<br>-	Job satisfaction.<br>-	Experience<br><br>At negative side u have: <br>         No family atmosphere &amp; u can not support the family.<br>         Missing us lot.<br><br>What we need is lot of money &amp; ur comfort<br><br>Now what u need is lot of money to have a medium scale set up.<br>Much more experience in administrative front. <br><br>It is my experience, the time when I was not having money, my family ( including ur Dad) had thrown me out , the moment I have got money everyone is come back.<br><br>2) On family front :  <br><br>Most of them are frustrated why- bcos   in earlier days pappaji used to earn lot of money &amp; used to spend that  as &amp; when he wants. Also family members used to have lot of money in their hand to spend &amp; to occupy their mind. Now they more or less are not working as their money support has been in eroded &amp; their expections regarding money matters are not fulfilled. As they don&acirc;&#8364;&#8482;t have money &amp; lot of empty time , this stage has come. Mamaji also able to stay at home till the time pappaji were occupied with lottery center ( Money &amp; time). The day that center had stopped the mamaji has to leave that home. He is  financially burdened &amp; that frustration reflects in family members behavior.  See ur dad is made of rock &amp; he doesn&acirc;&#8364;&#8482;t understand the emotions. He needs only money. It is only ur mom who needs u. U can do this by taking her to USA.in between<br><br>U can achieve all this by staying in states for few years instead of coming here permanently &amp; crushing all ur dreams &amp; desires.<br><br>Please do not take me other way round.as my language is very rough.<br>I will call u soon.<br>Wish u all the best.<br></pre>
