     _________________________________________________________________
   
   help [-rh] [<pattern>]
   
   This command gives help on the commands.
   
   Command options:
   
   -r
          Force reloading of the command help files before printing the
          help. Command help files are stored in the documentation area
          provided in the distribution. At times, the documentation may
          change. This command forces the reloading of the help files to
          reflect the changes. Only under rare circumstances, such as
          user define new tcl commands using docproc, do this option
          needed.
          
   -h
          Print usage.
          
   <pattern>
          If a pattern is given, only commands which match this pattern
          are listed. If the pattern given is the exact name of a
          command, a long display giving the complete help on the command
          will be printed. For example, if * given, all commands are
          listed. If sym* is given, all commands prefixed with "sym" will
          be listed. If no pattern is given, the default pattern is *.
