  sim_start - start simulation for module
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   sim_start [-hsun] <module> [<component> ...]
   
   This command starts and initialize simulation of the specified module.
   There are three modes of simulations: random, manual and game
   simulation. In general, user also specify the components that are
   controlled by the user to start a game simulation. For random and
   manual simulations which are two extreme cases of game simulation,
   there is no need to specify the components: for random simulation, all
   components are controlled by the system, while in manual simulation,
   all are controlled by the user.
   
   Command options:
   
   -h
          Prints usage.
          
   -s
          Specify that the specified components are controlled by the
          system. If no component is specified, the simulation is the
          same as manual simulation (no component is controlled by the
          system).
          
   -u
          Specify that the specified components are controlled by the
          user. If no component is specified, the simulation is the same
          as random simulation (no component is controlled by the user).
          This is the default option.
          
   -n
          Specify that the component names given are actually atom names.
          It is illegal to mix both sub-module names and atom names.
          Without this option, the component names are assumed to be
          sub-module names.
          
   <component> ... ;
          Names of the sub-modules that are controlled by the user
          (system in the case of -s is specified). If -n is used, the
          names are atom names.
