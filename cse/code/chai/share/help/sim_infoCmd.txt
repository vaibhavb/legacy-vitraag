   sim_info [-h] <module> <option>
   
   This command returns miscellaneous information about current
   simulation of the specified module, depending on the option supplied.
   
   Command options:
   
   -h
          Prints usage.
          
   <option>
          option can be one of the following keyword:
          
        isStartOfRound
                Returns 1 if the simulation is at the start of a round,
                and 0 otherwise.
                
        isEndOfRound
                Returns 1 if the current round has just finished, and 0
                otherwise. Usually if the simulation is at the end of a
                round, it is also at the start of the round and vice
                versa. But there is a subtlety: at the start of the
                initial round, isStartOfRound will return 1, but
                isEndOfRound will return 0.
                
        atomOrdering
                Returns a linear order of the atoms. The sub-rounds of
                execution are carried according to this order.
                
        variableOrdering
                Returns a linear order of the variables. Variables
                controlled by the same atoms are grouped together.
                
        isUserTurn
                Returns 1 if it is the user's turn during the simulation,
                and 0 otherwise.
                
        isInitialRound
                Returns 1 if the current round is the initial round, and
                0 otherwise.
                
        mode
                Returns the mode of the current simulation. The result is
                "random", "manual" or "game".
                
        isSimulated
                Returns 1 if the module is being simulated, 0 otherwise.
