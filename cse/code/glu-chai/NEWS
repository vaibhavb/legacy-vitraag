Version 1.3

* Configure now supports both gcc and native compilers on many
  systems.  The native compiler is the default, but this can be
  overridden by invoking "configure" with the "--enable-gcc" option.

  As a result, the following configuration options have been removed

    --with-comp-mode=solaris
    --with-comp-mode=mips
    --with-comp-mode=alpha32
    --with-comp-mode=alpha64

* Configure now defaults to using 32-bit pointers on DEC Alpha
  machines.  To use 64-bit pointers, invoke "configure" with "--enable-64."

* "gmake check" now compiles simple check programs that test some
  functionality of the BDD packages.

* New versions of CUDD (2.3.0) and CAL (2.0.1) are included.
