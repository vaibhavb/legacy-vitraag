\chapter {Verification Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

In this chapter we describe some techniques and the support in \mocha\
that enable the verification of large systems.
Section \ref{sec:monitors} describes how to verify more general safety
properties than invariants by using monitors. Section
\ref{sec:witness_modules} describes how to circumvent the
intractability of language inclusion by specifying witness modules for
refinement checking. Sections \ref{sec:abstraction_modules} and
\ref{sec:assume_guarantee} describe abstraction modules and
assume-guarantee reasoning for modular verification. 


\section{Monitors}
\label{sec:monitors}
Invariants can distinguish between two trajectories only if one of the 
trajectories contains a state that does not occur on the other trajectory.
Hence there are requirements on the behavior of a reactive module $\ro$ that 
cannot be phrased as invariants of~$\ro$.
However, many such requirements can be phrased as invariants of the compound 
module $\ro\|\mon$, for a monitor $\mon$ of~$\ro$.
The module $\mon$ is a {\em monitor\/}\index{monitor} of $\ro$ if $\mon$ is compatible with 
$\ro$ and $\intf{\mon}\cap\extl{\ro}=\emptyset$.
If $\mon$ is a monitor of~$\ro$, then in each round, $\mon$ may record the 
values of the observable variables of~$\ro$, but $\mon$ must not modify any 
external variables of~$\ro$.
Thus the monitor $\mon$ can observe but not interfere with the behavior 
of~$\ro$.
In particular, the monitor $\mon$ may check if $\ro$ meets a requirement, and 
it may signal every violation of the requirement by sounding an observable 
alarm.
The module $\ro$ then meets the given requirement iff the compound module 
$\ro\|\mon$ has the invariant that no alarm is sounded by the monitor~$\mon$.

\mypar
  Figure~\ref{fig:rail} presents an asynchronous railroad controller that 
  enforces the train-safety requirement.
  Yet the module \Controller\ is not a satisfactory railroad controller, 
  because it may keep a train waiting at a red signal while the other train 
  is allowed to cross the bridge repeatedly.
  In particular, the resulting railroad system does not meet the 
  {\em equal-opportunity requirement\/} that, while a train is waiting at a 
  red signal, it is not possible that the signal at the opposite entrance to 
  the bridge turns from green to red and back to green.
  Since the equal-opportunity requirement is violated by trajectories, and 
  not by individual states, we need to employ monitors.
  The module 

\mypar
{\tt
    \EqOppMonitorW\ :=\ \\
    \qu \EqOppMonitor[\level,\pc,\signalo,\signalt :=
      \levelW,\pcW,\signalW,\signalE]
}

\mypar
  monitors the equal-opportunity requirement for the train that travels 
  clockwise, where \EqOppMonitor\ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:monitor3}.
  The monitor has four levels of alertness.
  The alertness level is 0 as long as the train is not waiting at a red 
  signal while the other signal is green, in which case the alertness level 
  rises to~1.
  The alertness level rises to 2 when the other signal turns red, and to 3
  when the other signal turns green again, while the train is still waiting 
  at a red signal.
  An alertness level of 3 sounds an alarm that indicates a violation of the 
  equal-opportunity requirement for the train that travels clockwise.
  The equal-opportunity requirement for the train that travels 
  counterclockwise is monitored by the module 

\mypar
{\tt
    \EqOppMonitorE\ :=\ \\
    \qu \EqOppMonitor[\level,\pc,\signalo,\signalt :=
      \levelE,\pcE,\signalE,\signalW]
}

\mypar
in the same manner.
The module \Controller\ then meets the equal-opportunity requirement iff 
the observation predicate
\begin{center}
\tt \NOT(\levelW\ = 3 \OR\ \levelE\ = 3)
\end{center}
is an invariant of the compound module
\begin{center}
\tt \TrainSystem\ \pppar\ \EqOppMonitorW\ \pppar\ \EqOppMonitorE
\end{center}
The error trajectory of Figure~\ref{fig:error2} shows that this is not the case.


\section{Witness modules for refinement checking}
\label{sec:witness_modules}
The problem of checking if $\ro\refines\aro$ is PSPACE-hard in the state
space of~$\aro$.  However, the refinement check is simpler in the special
case in which all variables of $\aro$ are observable.  The module $\aro$ is
{\em projection refinable\/} by the module $\ro$ if (1)~$\aro$ is refinable
by $\ro$, and (2)~$\aro$ has no private variables.  If $\aro$ is projection
refinable by~$\ro$, then every variable of $\aro$ is observable in both $\ro$
and~$\aro$.  Therefore, checking if $\ro\refines\aro$ reduces to checking if
for every trajectory $\stateseq$ of $\ro$, the projection 
$[\stateseq ]_{\aro}$
is a {\em trajectory\/} of~$\aro$.  According to the following proposition,
this can be done by a transition-invariant check, whose complexity is
linear in the state spaces of both $\ro$ and~$\aro$.

\begin {proposition}{projection}\index{projection refinement}
  [Projection refinement]
  Consider two modules $\ro$ and $\aro$, where $\aro$ is projection refinable 
  by~$\ro$.
  Then $\ro \refines \aro$ iff 
  (1)~if $s$ is an initial state of~$\ro$, then $[s]_{\aro}$
        is an initial state of $\aro$, and
  (2)~if $s$ is a reachable state of $\ro$ and $s\, {\trans}_{\ro}\, t$,
        then $[s]_{\aro} \trans_{\aro} [t]_{\aro}$.
\end {proposition}

\mypar
\noindent
We make use of this proposition as follows.  Suppose that $\aro$ is refinable
by~$\ro$, but not projection refinable.  This means that there are some
private variables in $\aro$.  Define $\aro^u$ to be the module obtained by
making every private variable of $\aro$ an interface variable.  If we compose
$\ro$ with a module $\wit$ whose interface variables include the private
variables of~$\aro$, then $\aro^u$ is projection refinable by the
composition $\ro\|\wit$.  Moreover, if $\wit$ does not constrain any external
variables of~$\ro$, then $\ro\|\wit\refines\aro^u$ implies
$\ro\refines\aro$ (in fact, $\ro$ is simulated by $\aro$). 
Such a module $\wit$ is called a {\em witness\/}\index{witness module} to the
refinement $\ro\refines\aro$.  The following proposition states that in order
to check refinement, it is sufficient to first find a witness module and then
check projection refinement.

\begin {proposition}{witness}
  [Witness modules]
  Consider two modules $\ro$ and $\aro$ such that $\aro$ is refinable 
  by~$\ro$.
  Let $\wit$ be a module such that (1)~$\wit$ is compatible with
  $\ro$, and (2)~the interface 
  variables of $\wit$ include the private variables of~$\aro$, and are disjoint
  from the external variables of $\ro$.
  Then (1)~$\aro^u$ is projection refinable by $\ro \| \wit$, and 
  (2)~$\ro\|\wit\refines \aro^u$ implies $\ro\refines\aro$.
\end{proposition}
\mypar
\noindent
Furthermore, it can be shown that if $\ro$ does not have any private 
variables, and $\ro$ is simulated by $\aro$, then a witness to the 
refinement $\ro \refines \aro$ does exist.
In summary, the creativity required from the human verification expert is the
construction of a suitable witness module, which makes explicit how the
private state of the specification $Q$ depends on the state of the
implementation~$P$.

\caption{Witness modules for $\msgO$ and $\status$ }
\label{fig:syncmsgWitness}
\end{figure}

\mypar
Consider the \SRImpl\ and \SRSpec\ modules described earlier. They can be 
found in {\tt examples/msg}. Note that \SRSpec\ is refinable by
\SRImpl, but not projection refinable. We can use {\tt check\_simulation}
command to check that:
  \[\SRImpl\ \refines\ \SRSpec\]
In order to carry out a refinement check, we need to write witnesses for
the $\status$ and $\msgO$ variables in $\SRSpec$.  
First, the $\SSender$ and $\SReceiver$
modules from Figure~\ref{fig:syncmsg} need to be changed so as to
make their private variables visible. Let us call the new modules
as  $\USSender$ and $\USReceiver$ respectively. 
To avoid a name collision, the $\status$ variables of 
$\USSender$ and $\USReceiver$ are renamed
to $\pcS$ and $\pcR$ respectively. The witness modules for 
$\WitnessMsgO$ and $\WitnessSpecCtrl$, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:syncmsgWitness}
make use of these variables.
Now, we can compose the witnesses with the sender and receiver modules:

\mypar
{\tt
\USRImpl\ := \\
\qu \USSender\ \pppar\ \USReceiver\ \pppar\ \WitnessMsgO\ \pppar\ \WitnessSpecCtrl
}

\mypar
Finally, we change the private variable $\status$ in $\SRSpec$ to an external
variable, and obtain $\USRSpec$. The {\tt check\_refine} command
can now be used to prove that $\USRImpl$ refines $\USRSpec$.
The witness modules and the ``unhidden'' modules can be found in 
{\tt examples/msg/msgRef.rm}

\section{Abstraction modules}\index{abstraction modules}
\label{sec:abstraction_modules}

Consider two modules $P_1$ and $P_2$. Suppose, we want to show that
$P_1 \| P_2 \refines Q$. Sometimes it is possible to construct modules
$A_1$ and $A_2$ such that $A_1$ and $A_2$ are more abstract that $P_1$
and $P_2$ respectively. Then the following proof rule is correct. 

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
P_1 & \refines & A_1 \\
P_2 & \refines & A_2 \\
A_1 \| A_2 & \refines & Q \\ \hline
P_1 \| P_2 & \refines & Q
\end{array}
\]

\mypar
{\bf Example.} \\
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
P_1 & = & \SCountThree\ \LSQBRAC\ \done\ \ASSIGN\ {\tt z}\ \RSQBRAC \\
P_2 & = & \SCountThree\ \LSQBRAC\ \inc, \oouta, \ooutb, \ooutc\ \ASSIGN\ {\tt z}, \ooutd, \ooute, \ooutf\ \RSQBRAC
\end{array}
\]

\mypar
The specification $Q$ for $P_1 \| P_2$ is the following module.

\mypar
{\tt
  \MODULE\ \SCountSixSpec \\
  \qu \EXTERNAL\ \start, \inc\ : \bool \\
  \qu \INTERFACE\ \oouta, \ooutb, \ooutc, \ooutd, \ooute, \ooutf, \done\ : \bool \\
  \qu \PRIVATE\ \cnt\ : \BITVECTOR 6 \\
  \qu \ATOM\ \CONTROLS\ \cnt\ \READS\ \cnt, \start\ \AWAITS\ \inc \\
  \qu \UPDATE \\
  \qu \begin{chtab}
      \start\ \AND\ \NOT\inc' & \cnt' := 0 \\
      \start\ \AND\ \inc' & \cnt' := 1 \\
      \NOT\start\ \AND\ \inc' & \cnt' := \cnt\ + 1
   \end{chtab} \\
  \qu \ENDATOM \\
  \qu \ATOM\ \CONTROLS\ \oouta, \ooutb, \ooutc\ \AWAITS\ \cnt \\
  \qu \INIT\ \UPDATE \\
  \qu \choice\ \TRUE\ \limp\ \oouta' := \cnt'[0]; \ooutb' := \cnt'[1]; \ooutc' := \cnt'[2]; \\
  \qqu \ooutd' := \cnt'[3]; \ooute' := \cnt'[4]; \ooutf' := \cnt'[5] \\
  \qu \ENDATOM \\
  \qu \ATOM\ \CONTROLS\ \done\ \READS\ \cnt, \start\ \AWAITS\ \cnt \\
  \qu \UPDATE \\
  \qu \begin{chtab}
      \NOT\start\ \AND\ \cnt'=\cnt\ + 1\ \AND \cnt'=0 & \done' := \TRUE \\
      \DEFAULT\ & \done' := \FALSE
  \end{chtab} \\
  \qu \ENDATOM \\
  \ENDMODULE \\\\
}

\mypar
Then, we have the following abstraction modules.
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
A_1 & = & \SCountThreeSpec\ \LSQBRAC\ \done\ \ASSIGN\ {\tt z}\ \RSQBRAC \\
A_2 & = & \SCountThreeSpec\ \LSQBRAC\ \inc, \oouta, \ooutb, \ooutc\ \ASSIGN\ {\tt z}, \ooutd, \ooute, \ooutf\ \RSQBRAC
\end{array}
\]

\mypar
Here, $A_1$ and $A_2$ are more abstract descriptions of $P_1$ and
$P_2$. By inspection, we can see that the proof rule described above
is applicable.
We can show using {\tt check\_simulation} that $P_1 \refines A_1$ and
$P_2 \refines A_2$. Hence, $P_1 \| P_2 \refines A_1
\| A_2$. Therefore, we have that 
\begin{displaymath}
\HIDE\ {\tt z}\ \IN\ \LPARA P_1\ \pppar\ P_2\RPARA\ \ENDHIDE\ \refines\ \HIDE\ {\tt z}\ \IN\ \LPARA A_1\ \pppar\ A_2\RPARA\ \ENDHIDE 
\end{displaymath}
Now, we can use {\tt check\_simulation} to show that 
\begin{displaymath}
\HIDE\ {\tt z}\ \IN\ \LPARA A_1\ \pppar\ A_2\RPARA\ \ENDHIDE\ \refines\ \SCountSixSpec
\end{displaymath}
 

\section{Assume-guarantee reasoning}
\label{sec:assume_guarantee}
The state space of a module may be exponential in the size of the module
description.  Consequently, even checking projection refinement may not be
feasible.  However, typically both the implementation $\ro$ and the
specification $\aro$ consist of the parallel composition of several modules,
in which case it may be possible to reduce the problem of checking if
$\ro\refines\aro$ to several subproblems that involve smaller state spaces.
The assume-guarantee\index{assume-guarantee reasoning} rule for reactive modules \cite{AlurHenzinger96} allows us to
conclude $\ro\refines\aro$ as long as each component of the specification
$\aro$ is refined by the corresponding components of the implementation $\ro$
within a suitable environment.  The following proposition gives a slightly 
generalized account of the assume-guarantee rule.
 
\begin {proposition}{ag2} 
 [Assume-guarantee rule]
 Consider two composite modules $P = P_1 \| \cdots \| P_m$ and 
 $Q = Q_1 \| \cdots \| Q_n$, where $Q$ is refinable by~$P$.
 For $i\in\set{1,\ldots,n}$, let $\Gamma_i$ be the composition of 
 arbitrary compatible components from $P$ and $Q$ with the exception 
 of~$Q_i$. 
 If $\Gamma_i \refines Q_i$  for every $i \in \{ 1, \ldots, n\}$,
 then $P \refines Q$. 
\end {proposition}

\mypar
\noindent
We make use of this proposition as follows.  First we decompose the
specification $Q$ into its components $Q_1 \| \cdots \| Q_n$.  Then we find for
each component $Q_i$ of the specification a suitable module $\Gamma_i$
(called an {\em obligation module}) and check that $\Gamma_i\refines Q_i$.
This is beneficial if the state space of $\Gamma_i$ is smaller than the state
space of~$P$.  The module $\Gamma_i$ is the parallel composition of two kinds
of modules---{\em essential modules\/} and {\em constraining modules}.  The
essential modules are chosen from the implementation $P$ so that every
interface variable of $Q_i$ is an interface variable of some essential
module.  There may, however, be some external variables of $Q_i$ that are not
observable for the essential modules.  In this case, to ensure that $Q_i$ is
refinable by $\Gamma_i$, we need to choose constraining modules either
from the implementation $P$ or from the specification~$Q$ (other than~$Q_i$).
Once $Q_i$ is refinable by $\Gamma_i$, if the refinement check
$\Gamma_i\refines Q_i$ goes through, then we are done.  Typically, however,
the external variables of $\Gamma_i$ need to be constrained in order for the
refinement check to go through.  Until this is achieved, we must add further
constraining modules to~$\Gamma_i$.

\mypar
It is preferable to choose constraining modules from the specification, which
is less detailed than the implementation and therefore gives rise to smaller
state spaces (in the undesirable limit, if we choose $\Gamma_i=P$, then the
proof obligation $\Gamma_i\refines Q_i$ involves the state space of $P$ and
is no simpler than the original proof obligation $P\refines Q$).
Unfortunately, due to lack of detail, the specification often does not supply
a suitable choice of constraining modules.  According to the following simple
property of the refinement relation, however, we can arbitrarily ``enrich''
the specification by composing it with new modules.

\begin{proposition}{abs}
  [Abstraction modules]
  For all modules $\ro$, $\aro$, and~$A$,
  if $\ro\refines\aro\|A$ and $\aro$ is refinable by $\ro$, then
  $\ro\refines\aro$. 
\end{proposition}

\mypar
\noindent
So, before applying the assume-guarantee rule, we may add modules to the
specification and prove $P\refines Q\|A_1\|\cdots\|A_k$ instead of $P\refines
Q$.  The new modules $A_1,\ldots,A_k$ are called {\em abstraction modules},
as they usually give high-level descriptions for some implementation
components, in order to provide a sufficient supply of constraining modules.
In summary, the creativity required from the human verification expert is the
construction of suitable abstraction modules, which on one hand, need to be
as detailed as required to serve as constraining modules in assume-guarantee
reasoning, and on the other hand, should be as abstract as possible to
minimize their state spaces.

\mypar
\noindent
\mocha\ provides support for assume-guarantee reasoning. 
To be able to operate at a finer granularity,
\mocha\ decomposes a refinement proof at the
level of atoms (i.e, we treat $P$ and $Q$ as single modules and use
the atoms of $P$ and $Q$ as $P_i$'s and $Q_i$'s in the above proof
rule). The command used to carry out one step in the assume-guarantee
proof is {\tt check\_refine\_atom}.
The following is extracted from the command documentation for 
{\tt check\_refine\_atom}:

\mypar
{\tt
  check\_refine\_atom [-e] [-f <size or varlist> ] [-h] [-i <varlist> ]\ \\
  \qu [-k] [-o <fname>] [-r] [-v] <impl> <spec> <spec\_interface\_varname> 
}


\mypar
Do one step in the compositional refinement proof of ``{\tt Impl} refines
{\tt Spec}''. The step done corresponds to the atom that controls variable
named {\tt spec\_interface\_varname} in the specification (let us call this atom
atom1). The command does the following:   

\mypar
Given an implementation, specification modules and an interface variable
in the specification that controls an atom (say {\tt atom1}), construct new modules
``new specification'' and ``new implementation'' such that
(1) new specification contains {\tt atom1} only, and
(2) new implementation contains heuristically chosen
atoms from specification and implementation that control variables controlled
by {\tt atom1}, but do not include {\tt atom1} itself

\mypar
A refinement check between the new specification and the new
implementation is performed First, new specification and implementation
modules are created. The new specification contains just {\tt atom1}. The new
implementation contains chosen atoms from specification and implementation
that control variables controlled by {\tt atom1}, but do not include {\tt atom1} itself. At
this point the new implementation contains only ``essential atoms'' to do a
refinement check. 

\mypar
Further atoms may need to be added to the new implementation to constrain
its environment. There are two ways to do this:
\begin {enumerate}
\item
{\bf Automatic}: If the {\tt -f 0} (size) option is chosen, then the implementation
module is not grown any further. For the {\tt -f 1} and {\tt -f 2} options,
progressively larger ``constraining'' environments are chosen for the new
implementation module. (The default if no explicit {\tt -f} option is used is 
{\tt -f 2}) 
\item
{\bf Manual}: The user can also force specific variables to be controlled in
the new implementation by simply supplying a list of variables in the -f
option, e.g.~{\tt  -f \{var1 var2 \}}.
\end {enumerate}

\mypar
Preference is always given to choose atoms from the specification for the new
implementation whenever possible. However, the {\tt -i} option can be used to
choose specific atoms from the implementation.  

\mypar
{\bf Note 1}: Since atom names are mangled by MOCHA (to uniquify atom
names during parallel composition), we identify an atom by any variable that is
controlled by the atom.

\mypar
{\bf Note 2}: List of variables are specified by enclosing them in curly braces,
e.g.~{\tt \{var1 var2\} }.

\mypar
{\bf Note 3}: You also have to use curly braces if your variable name has array
indices, e.g.~{\tt \{foo2[0][1]\} }.

\mypar
{\bf Examples}:
Suppose the specification module is {\tt Spec} and implementation module is
{\tt Impl}. To do the sub-proof corresponding to a specific atom in the Spec that
controls variable {\tt myVar} use: {\tt check\_refine\_atom Impl Spec myVar} 

\mypar
To force variables {\tt foo1} and {\tt foo2[0]} to be controlled use: \\
{\tt check\_refine\_atom -f \{foo1 foo2[0]\} Impl Spec myVar} \\

\mypar
In addition, to force {\tt foo2[0]} to be constrained by an atom from Impl, use:\\
{\tt check\_refine\_atom -f \{foo1 foo2[0]\} -i \{foo2[0]\} Impl Spec myVar}

\mypar
{\bf Command Options}: 
\begin {itemize}
\item
{\tt -e} : do transition invariant check only at the end (after completing
     reachability) 
\item
{\tt -f 0|1|2|var\_name\_list} :
     \begin {itemize}
     \item
     0  :  only the ``essential atoms'' are chosen 
     \item
     1  :  chooses a bigger set of atoms than size=0. Guaranteed to be
     comparable with the new specification 
     \item
     2 :  heuristically chooses a bigger set of atoms than size=1 
     \item
     {\tt var\_name\_list} :  forces atoms controlling variables in {\tt var\_name\_list} to
     be chosen in the new implementation
    \end {itemize}
\item
{\tt -h} :  print usage 
\item
{\tt -i var\_name\_list} : 
     if the atom controlling variable in {\tt var\_name\_list}is chosen, choose it
     from the implementation 
\item
{\tt -k} : keep the new modules (for debugging purposes: default behavior if you
     do not use this option is to delete them) 
\item
{\tt -o fname} :
     write out the mdd variable ordering in file specified by {\tt fname}
\item
{\tt -r} :

A similar proof can be done for the $\GRANTINDEX$ atom. Finally, we
are left to verifying if the $\GRANT$ atom in $\Rmanager$ is correctly
refined in $\RmanagerImpl$. For all the above proofs, \mocha\
was able to choose the constraining environments automatically.
In this proof, however, it is necessary to manually force 
{\tt grant\_index} to be chosen from the implementation. 
We encourage the reader to try the following command
without the {\tt -i} option and interpret the resulting error
trace.
